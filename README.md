# Hello there!

I'm Andrew, the technical director at [Mutual](https://www.madebymutual.com). We design and develop websites using #craftcms and #nextjs. We have clients in the education, charity, publishing sectors, among others.


## ðŸ’¼ I'm hiring for multiple roles

I'm looking for multiple front end developers (with either React/Next.js or Craft CMS know-how) to come join me and the team to develop some really exciting projects we have coming up. It's a full-time role, and remote (with a few team meetups in different parts of the UK each year).

We're a small team, and as the name implies we treat each other equally. We're looking for somebody who values a good work/life balance and has a drive to make our company their own and drive it in new directions.

If you're interested in learning more, [here's a Notion with details](https://www.notion.so/mutual/Front-End-Developer-Position-7686e2a10bfe4c2ab1405cf8dcf14d87) or feel free to reach out to me [andrew@madebymutual.com](mailto:andrew@madebymutual.com).
